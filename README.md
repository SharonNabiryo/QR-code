## Overview

This is my first Frontmentor challenge. I'm glad I was able to complete it. I'm looking forward to more challenges.

This is a screenshot of my solution.

## My process

1. Initialized my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/SharonNabiryo). I then cloned the repository to my local machine.
2. Configured my repository to publish my code to a web address. I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for this.
3. Looked through the designs to start planning out how I'd tackle the project.
4. Before adding any styles, I structured my content with HTML to help me focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Wrote out the base styles for my project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Started adding styles to the top of the page and work down.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm poud of my flexbox journey. As challenging as it was getting the container element centered. I'm glad I figured it out.

### Continued development

I want to continue to improve my flexbox skills. I also want to learn more about CSS grid.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/) - This helped me with understanding parent-child relationships. I really liked these patterns and will use it going forward.
